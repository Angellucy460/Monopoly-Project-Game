# 🎲 Monopoly Game (React Edition)

The **Monopoly Game** is a web-based, React-powered digital version of the classic Monopoly board game. It simulates the core economic mechanics—buying properties, paying rent, upgrading, and managing funds—within a modern, interactive interface.

---

## ✅ Main Purpose

- **Simulate economic decision-making and strategy**: Players buy, upgrade, and manage properties to grow their wealth.
- **Deliver an engaging multiplayer experience**: Players take turns, interact with the board, and trigger core game mechanics.
- **Teach basic economics through gameplay**: Concepts like ROI, bankruptcy, and property value are introduced in a hands-on way.
- **Serve as a learning project for developers**: Demonstrates practical use of React context, state management, UI rendering, and game logic.

---

## 👥 Target Users

- Casual gamers who enjoy board games like Monopoly.
- Students and educators exploring economic principles interactively.
- React developers or learners studying a real-world, multi-component game.
- Groups of friends/family looking for a simple turn-based browser game.

## 💡 What Problem It Solves / What Makes It Unique

- 🧠 **Interactive learning**: Turns financial concepts into a fun, visual game.
- 🕹️ **No physical setup needed**: Everything runs in-browser—no board, dice, or pieces required.
- 🧩 **Modular and extensible**: Built in React, easy to expand with new features or player types.
- 🛠️ **Team collaboration ready**: Reflects real-world teamwork in code structure and roles.
- 🧪 **Supports testing and experimentation**: Ideal for trying new game mechanics or AI simulations.
